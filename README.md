# File Management Exam

For first time running the app can run these commands

- pnpm install
- pnpm dev
- or you can run both in one go `js pnpm install && pnpm dev`

For the second time onwards

- can just run `js pnpm dev` command

<h3>IMPORTANT NOTE:</h3>

Main branch used is `master` and for data persistence can take a look to `feature/OTA-with-data-persistence` branch I have decided to make it in a separate branch cause storing files data in local storage is causing local storage exceed qouta error and due to that reason I cannot showcase the whole flow especially for pausing/unpausing of extracting files. Thank you!
